# CS-250 Module 7 Final Project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I try to picture myself as the user and think about what problem I need solved and the easiest way to go about solving it.
User stories help give context to the functionality behind software. It enables any member of the development team to look
through the eyes of the target user and think about what is going to work best for them.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I tend to approach programming naturally working in increments. I will try to put together a loose overview of what I want
the product to be, then I decide on an easy place to start and go from there. I will try to code one small thing at a time,
each piece building on the last and moving the project closer to the target. I believe this is also one of the most important
processes when using an agile approach to developing software. By putting together small pieces, things tend to work better right
away with minimal bugs. When bugs do crop up, they are often much easier to fix than if you were trying to fit four or five large
pieces of the same project together written by different people. I think building in small increments is one of the key factors
that makes agile an efficient approach to managing medium to large projects.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is able to work on his/her own when needed as well as interact with the team. One needs to be able to give and take
constructive criticism and support. Each team member should lend their own expertise to the project and always be looking for a way that
they can help the team as a whole progress. The combined individual efforts of everyone involved will drive motivation and ingenuity to
produce a superior product.
